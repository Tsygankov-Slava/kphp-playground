# Developing
If you want to contribute to this project and engage in development , then for this you will need:

## Install PHP (for fast testing code)
### For Linux
1. Update your packages:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
2. Upgrade your packages:
```
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```
3. Install PHP:
```
$ sudo apt-get install php
```
4. Check:
```
$ php --version
```

### For macOS
1. Install PHP:
```
$ brew install php
```

### Check installation
```
$ php --version
```

If the installation was successful, you should see something like this output:
```
PHP 8.0.28 (cli) (built: Feb 14 2023 15:42:52) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v4.0.28, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Xdebug v3.2.1, Copyright (c) 2002-2023, by Derick Rethans
```

## Install KPHP (for compile project)
How to install KPHP, see the official documentation:
- [For Linux](https://vkcom.github.io/kphp/kphp-basics/installation.html#install-kphp-from-deb-packages)
- [For macOS](https://vkcom.github.io/kphp/kphp-basics/installation.html#install-kphp-for-macos)

## Install and run project for developing on PHP
1. Open the terminal and clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tsygankov-Slava/kphp-playground.git
```
2. Go to the project directory:
```
$ cd kphp-playground
```
3. Start the local php server on port 8000 (You can choose a different port):
```
$ php -S localhost:8000
```
4. Open [http://localhost:8000/www/index.html](http://localhost:8000/www/index.html) in browser. \
If everything went well, you should observe the main page of the project:

![](docs/images/main_page.png)

P.S. The code written in KPHP is interpreted by PHP without any problems. \
So use a `php server` for development and testing. When you have tested the code, it needs to be compiled and run on the `kphp server`.

## Compile and run project for deploy on KPHP
1. Compile `index.php`:
```
$ cd /kphp-playground/server/
$ kphp index.php
```
2. Run server:
```
$ cd kphp_out/
$ ./server -H 8080 -f 1
```
3. After starting the `kphp server`, you should go to http://localhost:8080/ and see the server page:
